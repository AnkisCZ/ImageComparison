# Looking for someone to maintain this project

Hi, I'm looking for someone to take over this project as I no longer have time to dedicate to it.

If you would like to do so, please contact me via an issue, make a fork and do your first change.
I can help you set up the CI and indicate on this README who is maintaining the project (name & url).

-------------------------------------------------------------

This is a fork of XnaFan.ImageComparison from http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/374386/Simple-image-comparison-in-NET

Here are the main differences:
* VS 2015 project
* .Net 4.5
* has a signed nuget package
* CI with appveyor
* droped COM interop
* bump version number from 1.6 to 2.0
